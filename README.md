# TidyData

This repo has a file called 'run_analysis.R' which is a script made for the Project course of Getting and Cleaning Data. The script will take as input the samsung datasets and apply data merging and transformations to get a new dataset as specified in the project instructions.

For more information please check the CodeBook.md, which is available in this repo.

Thanks,

Pablo
